# ComputationalLinearAlgebra
I was having trouble learning Computational Linear Algebra in college, so I figured the best way to learn it is to try and teach it.
My goal is to keep it accurate, but since I am still learning this stuff, if you happen to see something wrong, let me know. 
Also, design is not a strong consideration here. My goal isn't to make the "coolest" learning website. 
It should still [hopefully] work fine enough on mobile devices, though LaTex doesn't always play nice with the screen space, I've noticed.

I've been looking through various useful resources including:
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
- [Godot Engine Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/math/vector_math.html)
